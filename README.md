# PyBer_Analysis 
(Module 5)

## Overview of the analysis
On this analysis, we are working with data about ride-sharing trips in different types of cities.

### Purpose of the analysis:
What we are trying to achieve is to get the total fares, number of drivers and number of drives per city type, so we can compare and make informed conclusions based on the differences between them.

### Results:

As we can see on the image below, there is a consistency on higher fares on urban cities, followed by suburban cities and finally rural ones.

This makes sense given the data below. We can see that both the total number of drives and total drivers in urban cities is significantly higher than in the other two city types.

This results in a higer total of fares even though the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is lower in the urban cities.

## Description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types

### Ride-sharing data:

Total Rides
- As we can see on the above data frame, the total number of rides is significantly higher on urban cities, followed by suburban ones and finally, the rural cities.

Total Drivers
- We have the same findings here. Rural cities are the ones with less drivers and urban ones the ones with the most.

Total Fares
- The result of the above causes the same outcomes here.

Average Fare per Ride and Driver
- Both the average fare per ride and driver are actually higher in the rural cities.

Total Fare by City Type
As we saw on the final results, there is a consistency on higher fares on urban cities, followed by suburban cities and finally rural ones with the lower fares.

### Summary:
There is a big disparity between all the data between city types. With way more demand and lower fares in urban cities, and higher fares and less demand in rural ones.


## Business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types

### Recommendation #1:
Maybe some small increases on the fares in urban cities could help to be able to lower the ones in rural ones, and this way be able to lower a bit the cost of those rides and potentiate the usage of ride-sharing in this area.  

### Recommendation #2:
If we are able to do this, there would be more business on the rural cities and more demand for drivers to start working on those areas. Increasing this way the number of rides and lowering the average fare.

### Recommendation #3:
Rural cities usually have shorter distances, and that could be another factor why the demand is lower. Maybe the marketing approach on these areas should be different and add some value on the rides for shorter distances (kind of a 1 free ride every 10 rides).
